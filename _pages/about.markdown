# About Me 
Hi there, I have been scratching my head really bad trying to come up with a funnier way to introduce myself, until I realized that I'm just not a funny person. So I would just go straight onto the facts. 

I was born and raised in a small city in China. I'm now working as a Cloud Engineer in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Well, before that I studied CSE at Delft University of Technology and graduated in Jul. 2021 with Cum Laude. And before that, I was an investment project manager at Hebei Port Group ., Ltd in China for more than 6 years till that day in which I realized that I need to pursue my dream to work more with computers and less with people(and other nonsenses).

I would say I'm slight introvert. It means I would not be too excited when meeting new people and most of the time I have no issue being alone and mind my own business. But don't get me wrong. I do enjoy companionship or hanging out with friends, though I may not talk too much. Here are the things that I actually enjoy:
* coding(apparently I did not just cross 8000KM to do something I don't like)
* playing games and being suck at it
* watching movies(mainly si-fi and actions)
* playing with all sorts of cool gadgets 
* all sorts of animals(including spiders)
* cooking and eating(okay, just eating)
* being a better version of myself everyday in every possible way

## My 2022 Resolution
I made myself a five year plan before leaving China. 2022 is the fourth year and the previous years have been fruitful. Hopefully this year will remain on the right course. So these are the things I want to achieve in 2022:

* read one technical book every month
* obtain my first pro level AWS certification
* participate more actively in open source projects 
* write at least one post every month about what I've learned
* extend this site
* pass my inburgeringsexamen
* get my Dutch driving license


## Things I want to learn in 2022
My problem has always been too much I want to learn and too little time. But I would like to devote my time to the following stuff:
* new language: Go/Rust & Typescript
* configuration tooling: Ansible/Puppet
* container: openshift(kubernetes) & Docker
* application architecture
* testing
